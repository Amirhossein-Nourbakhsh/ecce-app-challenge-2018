Open Ethnic Restaurant App Link


Mission Statement
The Open Ethnic Restaurant App is designed to help aspiring restaurant owners within the extended Golden Horseshoe Area identify areas of large ethnic groupings that lack sufficient restaurants that cater to their ethnicity. The application utilizes open sources Canadian Census data to identify ethnic breakdowns and OpenStreetMap data to identify ethnic restaurants based on Census Tracts. This application assumes perfect competition between the restaurants, in which each restaurant equally shares portions of the ethnic group it caters to. It displays data regarding the population of each ethnic group, the amount of ethnic restaurants, and the ratio of ethnic customers per same ethnic restaurant cuisine type for large areas and individual census tracts. This application can be extended for use pertaining to other non-food service ethnic locations, such as retail stores that cater to specific ethnic groupings. 


Statement of Characteristics
The target end user for the Dashboard web application are decision makers planning to open new restaurants, especially ethnic specific restaurants within the extended Golden Horseshoe area in Ontario, Canada. Census data was formatted to display the population for each subdivision of ethnic origins for each census tract. OpenStreetMap data was downloaded, formatted and modified to unify the schema used for classification of restaurant types to match the nomenclature of the ethnic groupings. The web application includes pie and bar charts that provide a visual representation of ethnic distribution comparisons which also provides the numerical values for more a specific understanding. The visual widgets provide information to the end user about the ethnic population distribution per census tract, restraunt count by ethnic distribution per census tract, and the ratio between ethnic population and restaurant count of the same ethnic group per census tract. The web application also provides an interactive map of the census tracts that includes thematic map of the study area for each of ethnic groups. The user may toggle between the different ethnic groups to alter the thematic map based on their ethnic group(s) of interest. The web application provides a selection tool that is used to target specific census tract(s). The visual widgets show ethnic information for the selected census tract(s) providing the user with population and restaurant ethnic information for their specific area of interest. For example, the user may be interested in opening a Middle Eastern ethnic restaurant. By toggling the default ‘North American (NA) Ethnic Population / NA Ethnic Restaurant’ and toggling the ‘Middle East (ME) Ethnic Population / ME Ethnic Restaurant layer’ on, it may become apparent that the Thornhill neighbourhood is one of the regions that has a large population of Middle Eastern ethnic background with rarely any zero Middle Eastern ethnic restaurants. Therefore, the decision makers may want to focus their research for their new restaurant location in that neighborhood. Conversely, this application may also provide information discouraging a restaurant owner from opening an ethnic restaurant in an already saturated market. Following the earlier example, there is an over saturation of North American cuisine in Thornhill. The web application also provides the individual restaurant locations through the ‘Restaurant Locations’ layer which may be toggled to inspect the existing restaurant characteristics within the user’s area of interest.

Experienced with front-end design, OpenStreetMap crowdsourced data and various GIS software and APIs such as ArcGIS, FME workbench and Leaflet through co-op and GIS Day presentations. Through school work and personal projects, experience several programming languages such as Python, VBA, Javascript, HTML, CSS and C has been worked upon. In a past co-op position, a new campus map for the University of Waterloo was developed utilizing these skills.

I have passion for Remote Sensing and GIS projects. Utilizing my programming skills and experience to enhance and speed-up the project deliverables. Experienced with ESRI’s ArcGIS Desktop, I aim to familiarize myself with ESRI’s web applications through front-end and back-end development. Throughout ESRI’s 2018 App Challenge I wish to compare ESRI’s Javascript API, Web Appbuilder and Operations Dashboard with other open source web application platforms such as Leaflet and OpenLayers.














































Census data was formatted to display the population for each subdivision of ethnic origins for each census tract. OpenStreetMap data was downloaded, formatted and modified to unify the schema used for classification of restaurant types to match the nomenclature of the ethnic groupings. Layer toggles display the average amount of customers expected to be serviced by a new restaurant location for each census tract assuming perfect competition. Selecting a census tract repopulated the graphs within the application to show specific breakdowns for each ethnic grouping and restaurants within the census tract. A point layer representing the raw OpenStreetMap data may be toggled to inspect each restaurant location for it’s name and original cuisine classification as well as the formatted fields created. When a specific census tract is not selected, the application will populate the data in the graphs with the data found in the extent of the map shown. This ultimately empowers aspiring restaurant owners to identify optimal locations for ethnic restaurant or the type of ethnic restaurant that should be opened within a census tract. This application may also provide information discouraging a restaurant owner from opening an ethnic restaurant in an already saturated market. Although the application is limited by the inconsistency in crowdsourced data, it provides a general understanding of the potential market for each tract. Symbology for each ethnic grouping remains consistent across all data representation so a user can easily identify the data of interest in all the widgets used. The end-user is not required to performance analysis on the data sets as all analytical results are provided in the interface.
