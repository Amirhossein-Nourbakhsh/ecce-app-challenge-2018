# Campus+

## Mission Statement

A university’s environment defines a student’s experience over the course of their entire education. Our app “Campus+” easily connects students to the process of improving the spaces they use everyday, allowing them to pinpoint locations on campus to input comments, photos, suggestions, and more. With real-time data collection, campus updates can be evaluated, prioritized, and completed as efficiently and effectively as possible. 

Following Western University’s Open Space Strategy aimed to build on the beauty of campus, and transform campus centred around world class education and research, areas of change include:

* Human Place
* Transportation & Mobility
* Natural Environment

We believe through focusing on these principles, students can collectively contribute to transforming campus into a place designed to be the best for them.

## App Description and Usage
