Day One by Team Pathfinder
======

What is our Mission?
------

Moving countries isn’t easy.  Between finding the immigration office to get necessary documentation, the registry agency to get a health card, the motor association to get your license registered, and then finding the nearest IKEA to get furniture, the arrival process can be stressful, confusing, and complicated.

There are many programs and support services available to help new immigrants get settled, but the data existed in many siloed databases.  Different databases can be accessed through Federal and Provincial agencies, NGOs and charities, and community associations, but can get lost in a sea of information, and isn’t intuitive to someone with beginner level English skills.
 
Our idea was sparked from the experience one of our team members, who is an international student.  When he first arrived in Canada, the process of getting settled was accompanied by many logistical hurdles, and he could have benefitted from having a single, easy-to-use resource where he could look for everything he needed. Our mission is to make everyone’s “Day One” in Canada easier!

What is Day One?
------

The Day One app is designed to easily locate areas of interest that any new immigrant or international student may need when they first arrive in Canada. Users can search the Calgary area for information related to transportation, English language assistance, immigration services, and more!

Get Started with Day One
------
 
Once you enter the app you will be greeted with a simple overview of how to use the app. You can re-access this by clicking on the “about” icon. To understand the map better you can click the “legend” icon to see what everything on the map represents. Day One has four main functions that are available that will help you quickly find information. 
 
- **Near Me**
After clicking the “Near Me” icon, you will be prompted to enter in your address and the radius you wish to search. The function will then grab everything that is near your location and list it by category (i.e. schools, restaurants, grocery stores, etc.).

- **Query** 
After clicking the “Query” icon, you will be prompted by a window that will allow you to select (or de-select) a certain category (i.e. Health services, daily needs, childcare, etc.). Within the certain category you can type in a sub category (i.e. family clinics, hospitals, and walk-in clinics are valid sub categories for health services). You can then find the results of you query in the “Results” tab.

- **Layer List**
By clicking the “Layer List” icon, users can hide/ show certain points on the map by clicking the checkbox beside the desired category. 

- **Bookmark**
This function allows you to view special points on the map, so you can find them faster. To place a bookmark, click on the location you want to save. Then click on the “Bookmark” icon to pull up the bookmark list. Click the “Add” button and rename your bookmark. To delete an unwanted bookmark simply click on the “X” next to the “Edit” button.
