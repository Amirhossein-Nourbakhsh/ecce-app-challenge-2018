Hi, all! After completing my Masters in History from McMaster University, I wanted to challenge myself by learning a new discipline completely out of my comfort zone, and I soon became invested in McMaster’s GIS Department. I’m looking forward to all the planning and experimenting we’ll undertake during the App Challenge!
