I am a geomatics engineer currently studying a Master of Science in Geography at the University of Waterloo. With more than five years of work experience in geomatics and project management, I am convinced about the key role of geographic information science and technology to help us mitigate climate change.

I am a Masters of Environmental Studies student at the University of Waterloo. I did my Undergrad in Geomatics with Computer Science Minor. My education and experiences have made me very passionate about GIS, Open Data, Data Science, and app development. I’ve helped develop various apps, but the spatial apps such as this one have been the most exciting to work on.

I am an Environment & Business student, pursuing the GIS Diploma at the University of Waterloo. My work in the insurance industry exposed me to flood risk management, and the need to adapt for climate change in cities. I love how web mapping tools can be used to educate and visualise highly impactful phenomena regarding climate change. I learnt a lot through this challenge and I’m excited to see how GIS can be used as a communication and decision making tool.

Hi! I am in my 4th year of Geomatics at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy creating maps of places I’ve never been to. Creating bucket lists in that city, so that one day when I visit I can plan my trips, and accomplish them in the time allotted. I also enjoy sleeping, eating, instagramming, and snapchatting. If we get to go to San Diego I promise a vlog of our experience!
