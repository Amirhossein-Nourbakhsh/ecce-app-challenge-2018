# SportLogic - Map it. Find it. Play it. Love it.

In the modern digital age, now more than ever it is clear that sports provide a variety of
benefits, beyond pure recreation. Physical activity in general has long been known to have a profoundly
positive impact on both physical and mental well-being, and team sports offer additional benefits
associated with social interaction. Sports help build a sense of community and belonging by bringing
people together, and in the process can teach important life lessons such as dedication and teamwork.
The City of Vancouver is largely considered to be an active city, with a relatively health conscious
population that enjoys its personal fitness routines and social sports leagues. However, not everyone
who would like to engage in organized sports has the money or time, which have fixed schedules and
require a high level of commitment. Moreover, conflicting schedules can make meet-ups difficult when
planning casual games among friends.

The goal of our app is to encourage healthy, active lifestyles among citizens by facilitating the
quick and easy creation, promotion, and attendance of recreational pickup sports events among users in
Vancouver. The app allows users to host a pickup sports event by posting an event with its time,
location, and other relevant information. Other users can then use tool functions in the app to
systematically sort and search through the posts to find an event that best suits their lifestyle. Our app
serves to not only support physical activity, but to encourage trying new sports and meeting new
people.



## Getting Started

## Data Sources

Icons designed by Freepik from Flaticon
Park locations from the City of Vancouver Open Data Catalogue (vancouver.ca/open-government-licence)
Park information and photos from the Vancouver Park Board's Park Finder



## Limitations

As with all crowd-sourced information, there exists the potential for misleading or incorrect information.
Additionally, this app does not have the ability to control access to parks or the type of people attending events
(i.e. we cannot guarentee the park is available to use or how many people will show up).
