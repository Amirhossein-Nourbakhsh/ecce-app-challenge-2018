## **The Mission**

Have you ever been frustrated finding a parking spot when you are in a rush, or new to a city? We wanted to create a mobile application to tackle the issues of finding parking spots and some of the other issues that comes along with it.

Frustrated Parkers seeks to help users to find parking spots for their vehicles, be that a car, a bike, or even an electric car. Knowing if a street has a restriction or if it will be a no parking zone is helpful in planning where to park. More people are taking the environment into consideration by choosing to carpool, own electric cars, or bike to work. There are designated spaces for these kind of vehicles, and knowing where to park in these situations can help people to get a better parking spot. The app functionality aims to ease the access to parking spots for visitors and residents in Toronto, and to provide seamless and enjoyable experiences for parkers.

## **Project questions**

The Frustrated Parkers application idea was raised after looking at parking regulations in Toronto, and wondering about the following issues:

- How could it be determined if a street is a no parking zone or has a parking time restriction? Could that be represented on a map to help the users to park at the right spot?
- Parking restrictions change during a snow emergency, but if you are not from the area, how do you know in which street can you park or not? Users should be aware of when they need to move their cars from the street due to snow routes.
- Carpooling and electric cars have special designated parking which could give people a better parking spot. Are the citizens aware of this?
- Could the distribution of parking tickets help people to be more aware of where they park and pay more attention to street signs?
- Have you ever forgotten where did you park your car or got a parking ticket because you forgot to renew the park meter? Could and app help to track where you parked your vehicle and for how long has it been parked there?

## **How to Use the Application**

The app includes a Welcome Page (Swiping view) which allows to get to know more about the app, swiping across all the main functionalities.
