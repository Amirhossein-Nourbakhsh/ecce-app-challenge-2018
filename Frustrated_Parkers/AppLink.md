*Note*: While interacting with this app in the AppStudio Player for ArcGIS, you will see a watermark in the map view indicating that it is intended for developer use only.

*Tip*: After the app has downloaded and opened in the AppStudio Player, a grey handle for opening the AppStudio sidebar will be superimposed over the app display along the edge of the screen.  If it obscures any controls in the app, it can be moved out of the way with one of the following approaches:
 
1. Touch and slide the handle along the edge to a preferred location on the screen.
2. Tap the handle to open the sidebar and tap the icon at the bottom of the sidebar.  When prompted, choose yes, to hide the sidbar.  It can be restored by minimizing/closing the player and opening it again.
