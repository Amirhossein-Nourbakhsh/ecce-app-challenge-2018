The Kooks - CycleVan

CycleVan is an designed for people to use when planning a bike outing in Vancouver. We have compiled all the things around Vancouver that would be useful to a city-goer (and that have available information on Vancouver Open Data) into one easy to use application using ArcGIS Pro and Web AppBuilder (WAB).

This app is designed to promote a healthy outdoor lifestyle to itâ€™s users while also providing them with all of the necessary information and direction to contribute to their local and municipal businesses, decrease their environmental footprint, and to experience the extensive culture and history of Vancouver.

# How To Use

Use each widget to cater the data to your needs.

The Directions widget allows you to create a multi-stop route that you can tailor to intersect with as many points as they would like to. You can also edit the route manually to make use of the included bike path data that shows where bikes can easily traverse the city.

The Filter widget allows you to filter each dataset by a number of parameters to best suit your needs. For example, you could filter farmers market by the time of year they operate, the days they run, and the times they open. There are many filter options for each layer.

Want to know what art pieces are near you right now? The NearMe widget allows you to search a distance around particular points and specify the layers you wish to view. This is useful if you have just a few minutes to explore your local area.
