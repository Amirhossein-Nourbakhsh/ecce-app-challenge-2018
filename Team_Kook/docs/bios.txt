My name is Joshua Cullen and I’m from Cardiff, Wales. I moved with my family to Nova Scotia just under 10 years ago and have lived in West Porters Lake ever since. I recently graduated from Acadia University with a BSc in Environmental Science and am now at COGS studying GIS. I’m excited to be a part of the ECCE app challenge and I look forward to seeing what everyone comes up with!

Andras is originally from Hungary and moved to NS to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Geography from Saint Mary's University.
